Sandboxing
==========

Kha supports sandboxing via "lxc" containers. Tested on Ubuntu
12.10. Requires a kernel at least 3.5.0-21. For "lxc" to work, Kha has
to be run under a user with password-less sudo permissions.

It is configured by changing `support/kha.config` file:
```
[{kha, [{host, "example.com"},
        {xmpp_backend, ["kha@example.com", "jabber.example.com", "password"]},
        {container, lxc},
        {container_name, "cibase"},
        {container_opts, [{ephemeral, true},
                          {username, "ubuntu"}]}
 ]}].
```

User specified in username in container_ops should have password-less
sudo access for commands like `sudo apt-get install -y package` to work.

v1.0 architecture
==================

Rough sketch of v1.0 architecture:

1. Angular.js on client side
2. SockJS for communication, hence allowing to connect to any remote server
3. Server side
   * Control node
   * Builder node

Control node:
* mnesia for storing projects and builds
* project as a process

Project:
* name
* load config from .travis.yml
* build in place OR
* git clone url
* build instructions (manual or from git/config)

Builder:
* queue manager
* builder as a process

Communications:
* Both project and builder processes will be broadcasting updates with
gproc:bcast/3
* Session process will subscribe to appropriate keys

Notifications
* Notificators will be independent processes which will be getting
broadcasts from builders/processes
